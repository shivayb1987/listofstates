Good UI:https://goodui.org/#40

Have your code work a bit harder so that your users wonâ€™t have to.

Consider giving users the ability to recognize items which they have been exposed to before, instead of expecting them to remember everything on their own.

it's also possible to keep the visual element looking as is, but instead only increasing its hotspot or clickable area.

Try Keyboard Shortcuts instead of buttons only. 

Try progressive disclosure instead of overwhelming

Try smaller commitments instead of a big one

Try Progressive Reduction instead of being static. 

Try Explaining instead of assuming the obvious. 

Try Enabling Corrections instead of rigidness. 

Try Retries And Redos instead of single chances.
